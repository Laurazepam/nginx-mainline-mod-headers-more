# nginx-mainline-mod-headers-more

This is a [PKGBULD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) for nginx-mainline with the module [headers-more-nginx-module](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) added, so it can be easily installed and updated. 

This is really only meant for myself, but feel free to use it if you also happen to need this specific module. I'll try my best to keep this up-to-date at all times. You really shouldn't ever be running an outdated version of this.
