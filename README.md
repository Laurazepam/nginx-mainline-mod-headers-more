# nginx-mainline-mod-headers-more-PKGBUILD

This is a [PKGBULD](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) for nginx-mainline with the module [headers-more-nginx-module](https://github.com/openresty/headers-more-nginx-module) added. 

This is really only meant for myself, but feel free to use it if you also happen to need this specific module. I'll try my best to keep this up-to-date at all times. You really shouldn't ever be running an outdated version of this.
